Greatest XI

Hello and welcome to my Greatest XI web app.

Ronaldinho or Messi? Henry or Ronaldo? These are some of the questions football fans ask and debate about all the time.

Using the Greatest XI app, you can create a team full of your favorite players and show the world your Greatest XI!

Create your team with your desired formation, and if you change your mind you can always edit or delete it.

View other people's teams and leave a comment if there's anything you'd change!
